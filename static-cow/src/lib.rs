//! # API Overview
//! ## `ToOwning` and `IntoOwning`
//! [`ToOwning`] and [`IntoOwning`] are the most general traits provided by this
//! crate, and are the ones that you will implement on your own types.
//! `ToOwning` is a generalization of [`std::borrow::ToOwned`](ToOwned):
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! pub trait ToOwning<'o> {
//!     type Owning: 'o;
//!     fn to_owning(&self) -> Self::Owning;
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! Unlike `ToOwned`, it doesn't require that `Owning: Borrow<Self>`. Hence
//! `ToOwning` represents a type that can be converted into some version of
//! itself which owns its contents,  but which does not necessarily let you get
//! a reference to the original borrowing type back out from the owning one.
//! 
//! The lifetime parameter `'o` is a bound on the lifetime of the *owning* type.
//! In most circumstances, this can be `'static`, unless the owning type still
//! contains some resources which are borrowed. Wherever you see a lifetime
//! parameter named `'o` anywhere in this crate documentation, you can mentally
//! substitute `'static` unless you are doing something very unusual.
//! 
//! `ToOwning` has a blanket implementation for `T where T : ToOwned + ?Sized`.
//! The blanket implementation does the obvious thing of letting `Owning =
//! Owned` and `to_owning = to_owned`.
//! 
//! [`IntoOwning`], then is self-explanatory from its declaration:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! pub trait IntoOwning<'o>: ToOwning<'o> + Sized {
//!     fn into_owning(self) -> Self::Owning;
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! `IntoOwning` has a blanket implementation for `T where T : Clone`, which
//! makes `into_owning` the identity function. Therefore, if your type already
//! implements [`Clone`], you get an `IntoOwning` implementation automatically.
//! If you implement `IntoOwning` manually, you cannot implement `Clone`.
//! 
//! User-defined types which implement `ToOwning` and `IntoOwning` generally
//! should just call `.to_owning()` and `.into_owning()` on each of their
//! fields. Eventually there will be derive macros for this, but I haven't
//! written them yet.
//! 
//! ## `StaticCow`
//! [`StaticCow`], this crate's namesake, is [`std::borrow::Cow`](Cow) lifted to
//! the type level. While `Cow` is an enum, `StaticCow` is a trait. While
//! `Cow::Borrowed` and `Cow::Owned` are enum variants, this crate's
//! [`Borrowed`] and [`Owned`] are tuple structs which implement `StaticCow` (so
//! also does `Cow`). So instead of having a struct with a field `field: Cow<'a,
//! B>`, where `B: ''o` (remember, think "usually `'static`" when you see `'o`),
//! you can declare that field as `field: S` and let `S` be a generic parameter
//! `S: StaticCow<'a, 'o, B>`. Then, wherever the ownedness of `S` is known at
//! compile-time, the compiler can generate an appropriately-specialized version
//! of the function.
//! 
//! Like `Cow`, `StaticCow` requires `B : ToOwned`, which allows it to have
//! `Deref<Target=B>` for a supertrait. `IntoOwning` is another supertrait of
//! `StaticCow`.
//! 
//! ## `Idempotent`
//! Using [`Idempotent`] as a bound allows you to be generic over types that
//! implement [`IntoOwning`] but not [`ToOwned`].
//!
//! [`StaticCow`]`<B>` has [`Deref`]`<Target=B>` as a supertrait, so you can do
//! anything with a `StaticCow<B>` that you can do with a `&B`. However, in
//! order to provide this supertrait, its implementations require that `B :
//! ToOwned` so that they can rely on having `B::Owned : Borrow<B>`.
//!
//! `Idempotent` has weaker requirements, so its capabilities are necessarily
//! weaker as well, and it does not inherit from `Deref`. [`ToOwning`]`<'o>`
//! places no constraints other than `'o` on `Owning`, which means that as far
//! as the type system is concerned, `.into_owning()` is just a completely
//! arbitrary conversion. So, you can't do anything useful with a type that
//! might be `T` or might be `T::Owning` but you don't know which, because they
//! don't promise to have any traits in common.
//!
//! `Idempotent` puts back just enough information that it can be a useful
//! bound:
//!
//! 1. It can give you either a `T` or a `T::Owning`, *and tells you which*.
//!
//! 2. It constrains `T` such that `T::Owning::Owning = T::Owning`. This means
//! that you can call `into_owning()` on it as many times as you please and it
//! can *still* give you either a `T` or a `T::Owning`.
//!
//! `Idempotent<T>` is implemented by [`Change`]`<T>`, which holds a `T`;
//! [`Keep`]`<T>`, which holds a `T::Owning`; and by [`ChangeOrKeep`]`<T>` which
//! might hold either, determined at runtime. Calling `.to_owning()` or
//! `.into_owning()` on an `Idempotent<T>` always gives a `Keep<T>`.
//! 
//! # Example
//! In this example, we'll implement a slice iterator which returns the slice's
//! elements in reverse. Initially, it'll borrow the slice and clone its
//! elements when returning them. But, it will implement [`IntoOwning`], so that
//! at any time during iteration you can change it into an iterator which owns a
//! [`Vec`](alloc::vec::Vec). It will then pop the elements it returns off the
//! end of the `Vec`, without cloning them.
//! 
//! For starters, we'll declare our flexible iterator:
//! ```ignore
//! struct FlexIter<'a, S, E> {
//!     inner: S,
//!     index: usize,
//!     _phantom: CowPhantom<'a, [E]>,
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! `E` is the type of the slice's elements. And although the constraint doesn't
//! appear in the struct declaration, `S` will be an implementation of
//! `StaticCow<'a, 'o, [E]>`. Concretely, `S` will be either `Borrowed<'b,
//! [E]>`, which wraps a `&'b [E]`, or it will be `Owned<[E]>`, which wraps a
//! `Vec<E>`. `index` is one greater than the index of the next element we'll
//! return, and `_phantom` is a zero-sized object which has to be there to
//! satisfy the typechecker by having the parameters `'a` and `E` appear
//! somewhere in the struct's fields.
//! 
//! Now we'll create [`ToOwning`] and [`IntoOwning`] instances for `FlexIter`.
//! ```ignore
//! impl<'a, 'o, S, E> ToOwning<'o> for FlexIter<'a, S, E>
//! where
//!     S: ToOwning<'o>,
//!     E : 'o,
//! {
//!     type Owning = FlexIter<'o, S::Owning, E>;
//! 
//!     fn to_owning(&self) -> Self::Owning {
//!         FlexIter {
//!             inner: self.inner.to_owning(),
//!             index: self.index.to_owning(),
//!             _phantom: self._phantom.to_owning()
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! impl<'a, 'o, S, E> IntoOwning<'o> for FlexIter<'a, S, E>
//! where
//!     S: IntoOwning<'o>,
//!     E: 'o
//! {
//!     fn into_owning(self) -> Self::Owning {
//!         FlexIter {
//!             inner: self.inner.into_owning(),
//!             index: self.index.into_owning(),
//!             _phantom: self._phantom.into_owning()
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! You can see that the method implementations are completely rote, but all
//! these lifetimes flying around may be confusing. `'o` is a lifetime bound on
//! `E`, the type of the slice's elements. If the elements are just data, say,
//! `u32`, then `'o` can be `'static`. But if we have a slice full of
//! references, say, `&'x u32`, then `'o` is bounded by `'x`. `'a` is a lifetime
//! bound on the slice we're iterating over. So, if what we're given is a `&'b
//! [E]`, then `'a` is bounded by `'b`. But once we call `to_owned()` on the
//! slice, which gives us a `Vec<E>`, now `'a` is bounded only by `'o`.
//! 
//! Thus we can understand the implementation constraints and the type
//! declaration for `Owning`. We need an `S` which implements `ToOwning<'o>`,
//! and an `E` which can live up to `'o`. Concretely, `S` will be `Borrowed<'a,
//! [E]>`, which is a transparent wrapper around `&'a [E]`. This type does in
//! fact implement `ToOwning<'o>`, handing us back an `Owned<'o, [E]>` which is
//! a transparent wrapper around `[E]::Owned`, i.e., `Vec<E>`.  Given that these
//! constraints are satisfied, we can turn a `FlexIter<'a, S, E>` into a
//! `FlexIter<'o, S::Owning, E>`. Concretely, supposing `E` is `u32` so `'o` is
//! `'static`, we can turn a `FlexIter<'a, Borrowed<'a, [u32]>, u32>` into a
//! `FlexIter<'static, Owned<'static, [u32]>, u32>`.
//! 
//! If you understood that, then you should have no problem understanding the
//! constructor for a borrowing `FlexIter`:
//!
//! ```ignore 
//! impl<'b, E> FlexIter<'b, Borrowed<'b, [E]>, E> {
//!     fn new(slice: &'b [E]) -> FlexIter<'b, Borrowed<'b, [E]>, E> {
//!         FlexIter {
//!             inner: Borrowed(slice),
//!             index: slice.len(),
//!             _phantom: CowPhantom::default(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! And now we can implement `Iterator`:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! impl<'a, 'o, S, E> Iterator for FlexIter<'a, S, E>
//! where
//!     E: 'o + Clone,
//!     S: StaticCow<'a, 'o, [E]>,
//! {
//!     type Item = E;

//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
//!         // This is here to show that we can also access `inner` generically
//!         // through its `Deref<Target=[E]>` implementation, without having to 
//!         // match on `mut_if_owned()`.
//!         assert!(self.index <= self.inner.len());
//!
//!         match self.inner.mut_if_owned() {
//!             // We're borrowing the slice, so we have to work inefficiently
//!             // by cloning its elements before we return them.
//!             MutIfOwned::Const(slice) => {
//!                 if self.index == 0 {
//!                     None
//!                 } else {
//!                     self.index -= 1;
//!                     Some(slice[self.index].clone())
//!                 }
//!             }
//!             // We own the slice as a `Vec`, so we can pop elements off of it
//!             // without cloning.
//!             MutIfOwned::Mut(vec) => {
//!                 // It's necessary to make sure we first truncate the vector
//!                 // to `index`, because we may have already started iterating
//!                 // before `.into_owned()` was called, and this may be our
//!                 // first time calling `.next()` since we took ownership. Of
//!                 // course we could have had our `into_owned` implementation
//!                 // do this instead of doing it here.
//!                 vec.truncate(self.index);
//!                 let ret = vec.pop()?;
//!                 self.index -= 1;
//!                 Some(ret)
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! And now let's see it in action:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!     let mut borrowing_iter = FlexIter::new(numbers.borrow());
//!
//!     println!("Borrowing:");
//!     println!("{}", borrowing_iter.next().unwrap());
//!     println!("{}", borrowing_iter.next().unwrap());
//!
//!     let owning_iter = borrowing_iter.into_owning();
//!     std::mem::drop(numbers);
//!
//!     println!("Owning:");
//!     for item in owning_iter {
//!         println!("{}", item);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! Running this, we get the expected result:
//! ```text
//! Borrowing:
//! 5
//! 4
//! Owning:
//! 3
//! 2
//! 1
//! ```
//! 
//! This example is also available as `examples/flex_iter.rs` in the sources of
//! this crate.
